# Beacon-Clinical-Guidelines

## Introduction
Beacon Clinical Guidelines is an open source web and mobile application created by University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. The goal is to provide succinct guidelines for use by Trust staff. The initial focus has been upon local departmental information that act as memory joggers and points to more detailed proceses and procedures.

The solution is intended to be configured and installed by each organisation that wishes to use it, with content relevant only to that organisation. It currently consists of a web application, API and mobile (hybrid) application.
